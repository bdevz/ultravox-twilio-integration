# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables dynamic creation and management of Ultravox AI agents integrated with Twilio for voice calls. The system allows users to create agents programmatically, make API calls with dynamic variables, receive WebSocket URLs for streaming, and initiate phone calls that connect users to AI agents through Twilio's voice services.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to dynamically create Ultravox agents programmatically, so that I can generate agents on-demand without manual dashboard interaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a create agent request is made THEN the system SHALL call Ultravox API to create a new agent
2. WHEN creating an agent THEN the system SHALL accept agent configuration parameters (name, prompt, variables)
3. WHEN agent creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL return the agent ID and configuration details
4. IF agent creation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages with status codes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to initiate agent calls with dynamic variables, so that I can customize conversations based on specific context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making an agent call THEN the system SHALL accept dynamic template context variables
2. WHEN calling the agent API THEN the system SHALL include Twilio medium configuration
3. WHEN the API call succeeds THEN the system SHALL return a joinUrl for WebSocket streaming
4. IF the API call fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed error information including status codes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically initiate Twilio calls that connect to Ultravox agents, so that end users can interact with AI agents via phone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a joinUrl is received THEN the system SHALL create TwiML with streaming configuration
2. WHEN making a Twilio call THEN the system SHALL use the provided phone number and stream URL
3. WHEN the call is initiated THEN the system SHALL return call SID and status information
4. IF the call fails THEN the system SHALL return error details and troubleshooting information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple REST API interface, so that I can easily integrate the service into other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the API THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful endpoints for all operations
2. WHEN making requests THEN the system SHALL accept JSON payloads with proper validation
3. WHEN returning responses THEN the system SHALL use consistent JSON format with appropriate HTTP status codes
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with helpful messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure configuration management, so that API keys and sensitive data are properly protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN handling API keys THEN the system SHALL never expose them in logs or responses
3. WHEN configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about required variables
4. IF environment variables are invalid THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with descriptive errors

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN external API calls fail THEN the system SHALL capture and return meaningful error messages
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return specific field-level error details
4. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL log configuration status and readiness information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ability to manage multiple agents, so that I can handle different use cases and configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating agents THEN the system SHALL support multiple agent configurations
2. WHEN making calls THEN the system SHALL allow selection of specific agents by ID
3. WHEN listing agents THEN the system SHALL return all available agent configurations
4. WHEN updating agents THEN the system SHALL support modification of existing agent parameters
