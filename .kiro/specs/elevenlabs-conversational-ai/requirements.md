# Requirements Document - ElevenLabs Conversational AI Integration

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for replacing the current ElevenLabs Voice Message functionality with ElevenLabs Conversational AI, providing users with two powerful conversational AI options: Ultravox AI agents and ElevenLabs Conversational AI agents.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dual Conversational AI Platform

**User Story:** As a user, I want to choose between Ultravox and ElevenLabs conversational AI platforms, so that I can select the best technology for my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the web interface THEN I SHALL see two service options: "Ultravox AI Agent" and "ElevenLabs AI Agent"
2. WHEN I select "ElevenLabs AI Agent" THEN the system SHALL display ElevenLabs-specific agent creation and management options
3. WHEN I select "Ultravox AI Agent" THEN the system SHALL display the existing Ultravox agent functionality unchanged
4. WHEN I switch between services THEN the interface SHALL adapt dynamically without page reload

### Requirement 2: ElevenLabs Agent Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage ElevenLabs conversational AI agents with custom prompts and voice selection, so that I can build personalized AI assistants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create an ElevenLabs agent THEN I SHALL provide a name, system prompt, and voice selection
2. WHEN I select a voice THEN I SHALL be able to preview the voice before saving
3. WHEN I save an agent THEN the system SHALL validate the configuration and store it securely
4. WHEN I list agents THEN I SHALL see both Ultravox and ElevenLabs agents clearly differentiated
5. WHEN I edit an agent THEN I SHALL be able to modify all configurable parameters
6. WHEN I delete an agent THEN the system SHALL confirm the action and clean up associated resources

### Requirement 3: ElevenLabs Conversational Calls

**User Story:** As a user, I want to initiate phone calls using ElevenLabs conversational AI agents, so that recipients can have interactive conversations with AI assistants using high-quality voices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select an ElevenLabs agent THEN I SHALL be able to initiate a phone call to any valid phone number
2. WHEN a call is initiated THEN the system SHALL create an ElevenLabs conversation and connect it to Twilio
3. WHEN the call connects THEN the recipient SHALL be able to have a natural conversation with the AI agent
4. WHEN the conversation ends THEN the system SHALL properly clean up resources and log the interaction
5. WHEN there are errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and graceful degradation

### Requirement 4: Unified Agent Management Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want a consistent interface for managing both Ultravox and ElevenLabs agents, so that I can efficiently work with both platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the agent list THEN I SHALL see agents from both platforms with clear type indicators
2. WHEN I create agents THEN the interface SHALL adapt to show platform-specific options
3. WHEN I manage agents THEN common operations (create, edit, delete, list) SHALL work consistently
4. WHEN I switch platforms THEN the interface SHALL maintain context and user selections where appropriate

### Requirement 5: Voice Selection and Preview

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select and preview ElevenLabs voices for my conversational agents, so that I can choose the most appropriate voice for each use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create an ElevenLabs agent THEN I SHALL see a dropdown of available voices
2. WHEN I select a voice THEN I SHALL be able to play a preview sample
3. WHEN I preview a voice THEN the system SHALL generate a short sample using the selected voice
4. WHEN voices are loaded THEN the system SHALL cache them for improved performance
5. WHEN voice loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options and clear error messages

### Requirement 6: Call Tracking and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive tracking and monitoring of ElevenLabs conversational calls, so that I can monitor usage, performance, and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ElevenLabs calls are made THEN the system SHALL log all relevant metrics and events
2. WHEN calls are in progress THEN the system SHALL track conversation status and duration
3. WHEN calls complete THEN the system SHALL record completion status and cleanup resources
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting
5. WHEN monitoring the system THEN administrators SHALL have visibility into both Ultravox and ElevenLabs call metrics

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Security

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure configuration management for ElevenLabs Conversational AI, so that API keys and sensitive data are properly protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN ElevenLabs API keys SHALL be stored securely in environment variables

5. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use secure authentication and error handling

### Requirement 8: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want the system to maintain all existing Ultravox functionality unchanged, so that my current workflows continue to work seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Ultravox agents THEN all existing functionality SHALL work exactly as before
2. WHEN the system starts THEN existing Ultravox agents SHALL be available and functional
3. WHEN making Ultravox calls THEN the process SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN viewing call history THEN existing Ultravox calls SHALL be properly displayed
5. WHEN the system is updated THEN no existing Ultravox configuration SHALL be lost or modified
