## Implementation Notes

### Backward Compatibility Strategy
- All existing Ultravox functionality remains completely unchanged
- New ElevenLabs features are additive and optional
- Default behavior continues to be Ultravox-focused
- Existing API endpoints maintain their current behavior
- Configuration is purely additive with no breaking changes

### Development Approach
- Implement ElevenLabs components as separate modules alongside existing code
- Use dependency injection to avoid tight coupling between services
- Maintain the same architectural patterns as existing Ultravox integration
- Follow existing code style, error handling, and logging conventions
- Ensure all new code includes comprehensive tests and documentation

### Testing Strategy
- Create comprehensive unit tests for all new components
- Implement integration tests that don't consume ElevenLabs API quota
- Add performance tests for audio generation and memory usage
- Create end-to-end tests for complete call flows
- Ensure existing Ultravox tests continue to pass without modification

### Deployment Considerations
- ElevenLabs features can be enabled/disabled via configuration
- Service continues to operate normally if ElevenLabs is unavailable
- Graceful degradation when ElevenLabs quota is exceeded
- Clear error messages guide users when ElevenLabs features are unavailable
- Monitoring and alerting for ElevenLabs service health and quota usage
