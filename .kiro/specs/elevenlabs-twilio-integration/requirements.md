# Requirements Document - ElevenLabs-Twilio Integration

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing voice call integration service to support ElevenLabs AI voice synthesis alongside the current Ultravox integration. The system will provide users with the choice between Ultravox AI agents (conversational AI) and ElevenLabs voice synthesis (text-to-speech) for different use cases, while maintaining the same Twilio infrastructure for call delivery.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to choose between Ultravox AI agents and ElevenLabs voice synthesis when creating voice calls, so that I can use the most appropriate technology for my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the voice call creation interface THEN the system SHALL provide options to select either "Ultravox AI Agent" or "ElevenLabs Voice Synthesis"
2. WHEN a user selects "ElevenLabs Voice Synthesis" THEN the system SHALL display ElevenLabs-specific configuration options
3. WHEN a user selects "Ultravox AI Agent" THEN the system SHALL display the existing Ultravox agent selection interface
4. IF no selection is made THEN the system SHALL default to Ultravox AI Agent mode

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create ElevenLabs voice synthesis calls with custom text and voice selection, so that I can deliver pre-written messages with high-quality AI voices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an ElevenLabs call THEN the system SHALL require a text message input (max 5000 characters)
2. WHEN creating an ElevenLabs call THEN the system SHALL provide a dropdown of available ElevenLabs voices
3. WHEN creating an ElevenLabs call THEN the system SHALL allow voice settings configuration (speed, stability, clarity)
4. WHEN the text exceeds character limits THEN the system SHALL display validation errors
5. WHEN voice synthesis is requested THEN the system SHALL validate ElevenLabs API connectivity before proceeding

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure ElevenLabs API credentials and settings, so that the service can authenticate and interact with ElevenLabs services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the system SHALL accept ElevenLabs API key via environment variables
2. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL validate ElevenLabs API connectivity
3. WHEN ElevenLabs API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL log errors and disable ElevenLabs features
4. WHEN ElevenLabs quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
5. IF ElevenLabs configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL continue to operate with Ultravox-only functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to initiate ElevenLabs voice calls via API, so that I can programmatically send voice messages using text-to-speech technology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making an API call to create ElevenLabs voice calls THEN the system SHALL accept text, voice_id, and phone_number parameters
2. WHEN processing ElevenLabs calls THEN the system SHALL generate audio using ElevenLabs API
3. WHEN audio generation is complete THEN the system SHALL initiate a Twilio call with the generated audio
4. WHEN the call is successful THEN the system SHALL return call details including call_sid and status
5. WHEN ElevenLabs API fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to monitor and manage both Ultravox and ElevenLabs calls from a unified interface, so that I can track all voice communications regardless of the underlying technology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing call history THEN the system SHALL display both Ultravox and ElevenLabs calls in a unified list
2. WHEN displaying call details THEN the system SHALL indicate the call type (Ultravox AI or ElevenLabs TTS)
3. WHEN filtering calls THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by call type, date, and status
4. WHEN managing calls THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate actions for each call type
5. WHEN exporting call data THEN the system SHALL include call type and technology-specific metadata

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring for ElevenLabs integration, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ElevenLabs calls are processed THEN the system SHALL log API requests, responses, and timing
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including ElevenLabs error codes
3. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the system SHALL include ElevenLabs API status in health checks
4. WHEN tracking usage THEN the system SHALL record character count, voice usage, and API quota consumption
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide metrics for both Ultravox and ElevenLabs usage

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ElevenLabs integration to follow the same security and authentication patterns as the existing Ultravox integration, so that the system maintains consistent security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing ElevenLabs features THEN the system SHALL require the same API key authentication as Ultravox features
2. WHEN storing ElevenLabs credentials THEN the system SHALL use the same secure environment variable patterns
3. WHEN validating requests THEN the system SHALL apply the same input validation and sanitization
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL follow the same error handling and logging patterns
5. WHEN rate limiting THEN the system SHALL apply consistent rate limiting across both integrations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to preview ElevenLabs voices before making calls, so that I can select the most appropriate voice for my message.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting an ElevenLabs voice THEN the system SHALL provide a voice preview feature
2. WHEN previewing voices THEN the system SHALL generate a short sample audio using the selected voice
3. WHEN voice settings are changed THEN the system SHALL update the preview accordingly
4. WHEN preview generation fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN multiple previews are requested THEN the system SHALL manage API quota efficiently
